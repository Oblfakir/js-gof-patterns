    showPatternDescription('Bridge',
    [`The Bridge pattern allows two components, a client and a service, 
    to work together with each component having its own interface. Bridge 
    is a high-level architectural pattern and its main goal is to write better 
    code through two levels of abstraction. It facilitates very loose coupling 
    of objects. It is sometimes referred to as a double Adapter pattern.`
    ,`An example of the Bridge pattern is an application (the client) and a database 
    driver (the service). The application writes to a well-defined database API, for 
    example ODBC, but behind this API you will find that each driver's implementation 
    is totally different for each database vendor (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, etc.).`
    ,`The Bridge pattern is a great pattern for driver development but it is rarely 
    seen in JavaScript.`])
